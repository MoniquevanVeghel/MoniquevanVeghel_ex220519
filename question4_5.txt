question4:

select gene_name, (seq_region_end - seq_region_start) as length from gene order by length limit 1;

# gene_name, length
'TRDD1', '7'

question5:
Give the name of the chromosome with the second most genes that tell something about cancer. What is the number of exons of this chromosome? (2 queries)

select chromosome, count(gene_name) as total_genes from gene where description like "%cancer%" group by chromosome order by total_genes desc limit 1 offset 1;

# chromosome, total_genes
'9', '5'

select count(exon.exon_id) from exon join exon_transcript on exon.exon_id=exon_transcript.exon_id join transcript on exon_transcript.transcript_id = transcript.transcript_id join gene on transcript.gene_id=gene.gene_id where chromosome = 9;

# count(exon.exon_id)
'45679'
